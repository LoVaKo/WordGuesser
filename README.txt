# WordGuesser
## A command-line based word guesser game.
---
### About
This is a simple, commandline-based word guessing game that I created to practice most basic python skills such as file handling, importing, iterating, OOP and more. I tried to comply to PEP8 guidelines and focussed on good documentation.

A fun, easy to understand program that deals with a lot of the basics. Good for programmers that are just starting out to mess around with!

### Features
- Five difficulty levels
- Each game has 10 rounds
- Highscore system (points and time spent) for each level

### How to run it
Download the project and run wordguesser.py
There are no additional requirements besides python 3.10.
Make sure your file tree looks like this so the program can find the right files:

'''
wordguesser/
├── code/
│   ├── game.py
│   ├── highscore_utils.py
│   ├── player.py
│   ├── round.py
│   └── wordguesser.py
└── data/
    └── highscore.json
