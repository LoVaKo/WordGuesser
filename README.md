# WordGuesser
## A command-line based word guesser game.
---
### About
This is a simple, commandline-based word guessing game. I created this to practice most basic python skills such as file handling, importing, iterating, OOP and more. I tried to comply to PEP8 guidelines and focussed on good documentation.

A fun, easy to understand program that deals with a lot of the basics. Good for programmers that are just starting out to mess around with!

### Features
- Five difficulty levels
- Each game consists of 10 rounds
- Highscore system (points and time spent) for each level
